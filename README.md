## Data Description
This data was found from Kaggle and converted from a csv file to an excel file to be used in Tableau. Access the Kaggle site [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset). 

A majority of the questions are answered with drop-down selections with limited options (no free response) 

Out of the 24 variables in this dataset, this analysis uilizes the following:
1. Age (int): age of surveyor
2. Gender (str): Gender (Female, Male, Other)
3. Purchase_Frequency (str): How frequently do you make purchases on Amazon?
4. Purchase_Categories (str): What product categories do you typically purchase on Amazon?
5. Browsing_Frequency (str): How often do you browse Amazon's website or app?
6.Cart_Abandonment_Factors (str): What factors influence your decision to abandon a purchase in your cart?
7.Improvement_Areas (str): Are there any areas where you think Amazon can improve?
## Interpreting Visualizations

The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of each gender's browsing and purchasing frequency. This graphic can help us identify what gender to target certain ads or promotions to close the gap between their purchasing and browsing history. From the chart, we can see that a large amount of the surveyors browse a few times a week. The large majority of those customers only make purchases a few times a month and most of those customers are women. We can see that Women are most likley to browse weekly but only purchase monthly. Amazon must target women who browse weekly and incentivise them to purchase more. This could look like email corespondence about sales on items they were browsing.

The heat map shows the largest categories of reasons for cart abandonment and areas of improvement. This can help us identify ways to increase purchase frequency. The largest areas for improvement are customer service responsiveness. To increase a customers purchase frequency, the results suggest that Amazon should invest in increasing customer service responsiveness. This could look like hiring more customer service representatives or improving their current system. The largest factor leading towards a customer abandoning their cart is that they found a better price elsewhere. To convert that abandoned cart into a purchase, Amazon must stay competetive on price. This could look like targeted promotions, sales, price matching, or providing something extra that warrents the higher price.
